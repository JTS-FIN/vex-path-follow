# Vex IQ - Path follow (RobotC) ver. 1

Made a "self driving car" with Vex IQ robotics. In this implementation, the code tries to "stay outside the tape/path" as well as possible and follow the planned path that way. So it will constantly hit the edge of the path from the outside and keep moving forward. Video will explain it much better than I can do, so please check it out below.
